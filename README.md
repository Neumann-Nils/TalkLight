This application introduces an easy way to communicate witch each other with just only **light**. We have created an Android-App wich allows you to synchronize and control several Philip Hues over an Node js server, no matter where you or your partner is located. 

## Code Example

Show what the library does as concisely as possible, developers should be able to figure out **how** your project solves their problem by looking at the code example. Make sure the API you are showing off is obvious, and that your code is short and concise.

## Motivation

In this times many people have fast changing life with fast changing residences. Many people today live in a long-distance relationship and have the feeling they are not included in the everyday life of their partner. Our goal is to achieve an intuituve and easy way of communication, which helps people to stay connected and creates the feeling of beeing near to your partner.
